Simple Web Server in Java which allows you to call 
localhost:9000/ and show you the root.html webpage from the www/root.html folder
You can also do some other simple GET requests:
1) /random shows you a random picture (well random from the set defined)
2) json shows you the response as JSON for /random instead the html page
3) /file/filename shows you the raw file (not as HTML)
4) /multiply?num1=3&num2=4 multiplies the two inputs and responses with the result
5) /github?query=users/amehlhase316/repos (or other GitHub repo owners) will lead to receiving
   JSON which will for now only be printed in the console. See the todo below

The reading of the request is done "manually", meaning no library that helps making things a 
little easier is used. This is done so you see exactly how to pars the request and 
write a response back
